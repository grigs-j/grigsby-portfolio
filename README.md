This is my portfolio page created using HTML, SASS, JavaScript, and Adobe Illustrator.

My main focus was aethetics and functionality. I built the website from scratch utilizing basic design principles, color, typography, and UI/UX design.

##
My projects include a freelance website built from scratch,

a React app utilizing hooks, states, API pulls, styled components, and local storage,

a calculator built using javascript, html, and css,

various template clone websites, and illustrator projects.
